# Shengwei Xu

I'm Shengwei Xu, a final-year undergrad at Turing Class, Peking University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Yuqing Kong. I am also pleased to have worked with Tracy Xiao Liu and Grant Schoenebeck during my undergraduate years.

My research interest lies in the intersection of computer science and economics: algorithmic game theory, information elicitation, mechanism design.

I am currently applying for PhD (21Fall).
